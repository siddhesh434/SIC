            The Sophisticated instrumentation center (SIC) was established in September 2011 with institute funding to expedite the research program at IIT Indore. SIC has now emerged as one of the first such centers in the country, providing extensive analytical instrument support to the users of the research fraternity across the country. A major advantage of SIC is its accessibility to the students within the institute as well as to other institutes and industries. A very healthy ratio of students to the time availability on instruments and the quick analysis of external samples makes it a very useful facility.
